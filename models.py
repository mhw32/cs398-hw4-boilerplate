            Each index in this tensor represents the likelihood of predicting
            1. Unlike IRT, this is a multilabel prediction program so we need
            to have a likelihood for every feedback. NOTE: this is NOT categorical
            since we can have multiple feedback at once. 

            This will be given to F.binary_cross_entropy(...), just like IRT!
